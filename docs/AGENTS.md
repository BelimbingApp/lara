# Documentation Organization Guide

This guide helps agents understand where to place different types of documentation files in the `docs/` directory.

- When generating temporary, task-specific documentation (e.g., for coding, design spikes, or research that can be discarded after the task), use the `docs/scratch/` directory.
 - When generating implementation references, use the `docs/development/{module}/` directory.
 - When generating tutorials, use the `docs/tutorials/` directory.
 - and so on.
