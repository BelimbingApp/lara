## Overview

Caddy is a powerful, production-ready web server with automatic HTTPS that serves as Belimbing's reverse proxy. This guide explains Caddy basics and how to configure Caddyfiles for your Belimbing projects.

---

## What is Caddy?

Caddy is a modern web server and reverse proxy written in Go. It's designed to be simple, secure, and performant.

### Key Features

- **Automatic HTTPS:** Caddy automatically obtains and renews SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt
- **Zero Configuration:** Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Reverse Proxy:** Efficiently routes requests to backend services
- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3:** Modern protocol support
- **Easy Configuration:** Simple, human-readable Caddyfile syntax

### Why Caddy for Development?

- **HTTPS by Default:** Modern web features (Service Workers, WebAuthn, etc.) require HTTPS
- **No Manual Certificate Management:** Automatic certificate generation for local development
- **Simple Configuration:** Easy to understand and modify
- **Fast:** Low latency and high performance

## Caddyfile Basics

A Caddyfile is Caddy's configuration file. It uses a simple, declarative syntax.

### Basic Structure

```
site_address {
    directive
    directive value
}
```

### Site Address Format

```
scheme://hostname:port
```

Examples:
- `https://example.com` - HTTPS on port 443
- `http://localhost:8080` - HTTP on port 8080
- `https://example.com` - HTTPS (default)

## Belimbing's Caddyfile Structure

Belimbing uses Caddyfiles in different contexts:

### 1. The Main Caddyfile

Located in the project root (`$PROJECT_ROOT/Caddyfile`), this single file handles all environments using Caddy's environment variable syntax (`{$VAR}`).

```caddyfile
{
    # Global options
}

{$APP_DOMAIN} {
    # TLS Configuration
    # - Local: "internal" for self-signed
    # - Prod: Email address for Let's Encrypt
    tls {$TLS_MODE}

    # Logging
    log {
        output file .caddy/logs/access.log
        format console
    }

    # Vite / Frontend Config
    handle /build/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:{$VITE_PORT} {
            header_up Host {host}
            header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
            header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        }
    }

    handle /assets/* {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:{$VITE_PORT} {
            header_up Host {host}
            header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
            header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        }
    }

    # Laravel Backend
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:{$APP_PORT} {
        header_up Host {host}
        header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        header_up X-Forwarded-Port {server_port}
    }
}
```

## Key Directives Explained

### `tls`

Configures TLS/SSL certificates.

**Development (automatic):**
```caddyfile
tls internal
```
Uses Caddy's internal CA for automatic local certificates.

**Production (manual certificates):**
```caddyfile
tls certs/domain.pem certs/domain-key.pem
```
Uses provided certificate files.

### `reverse_proxy`

Forwards requests to a backend server.

**Basic usage:**
```caddyfile
reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

**With headers:**
```caddyfile
reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000 {
    header_up Host {host}
    header_up X-Real-IP {remote_host}
    header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
    header_up X-Forwarded-Port {server_port}
}
```

**Header explanations:**
- `Host {host}` - Preserves the original host header
- `X-Real-IP {remote_host}` - Passes the client's real IP address
- `X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}` - Indicates the original protocol (http/https)
- `X-Forwarded-Port {server_port}` - Indicates the original port

### `handle`

Routes requests based on path patterns. Handles are processed in order.

```caddyfile
handle /build/* {
    reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:5173
}

handle /assets/* {
    reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:5173
}
```

**Path matching:**
- `/build/*` - Matches `/build/` and all paths under it
- `/assets/*` - Matches `/assets/` and all paths under it

### `log`

Configures request logging.

```caddyfile
log {
    output file .caddy/logs/local-access.log
    format console
}
```

**Options:**
- `output file <path>` - Write logs to a file
- `format console` - Human-readable format

### Global Options Block

```caddyfile
{
    auto_https off
    admin unix//tmp/caddy-blb-local-$$.sock
}
```

**Options:**
- `auto_https off` - Disables automatic HTTPS (useful when using manual certificates)
- `admin <address>` - Caddy's admin API endpoint

## Request Flow in Belimbing

### Development Request Flow

```
Browser Request: https://local.blb.lara/build/app.js
    ↓
Caddy receives HTTPS request
    ↓
Caddy matches /build/* handle
    ↓
Caddy forwards to Vite: http://127.0.0.1:5173/build/app.js
    ↓
Vite compiles and serves the file
    ↓
Caddy returns compiled JavaScript to browser
```

### Laravel Request Flow

```
Browser Request: https://local.blb.lara/api/users
    ↓
Caddy receives HTTPS request
    ↓
Caddy doesn't match /build/* or /assets/* handles
    ↓
Caddy forwards to Laravel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/users
    ↓
Laravel processes request and returns response
    ↓
Caddy returns response to browser
```

## Common Configuration Patterns

### Multiple Domains

```caddyfile
frontend.blb.lara {
    reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:5174
}

api.blb.lara {
    reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000
}
```

### Default HTTPS (443)

```caddyfile
https://local.blb.lara {
    tls certs/local.blb.lara.pem certs/local.blb.lara-key.pem
    reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:5174
}
```

### Path-Based Routing

```caddyfile
local.blb.lara {
    handle /api/* {
        reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000
    }

    handle /admin/* {
        reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:8001
    }

    handle {
        reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:5174
    }
}
```

### Static File Serving

```caddyfile
local.blb.lara {
    handle /static/* {
        file_server {
            root /path/to/static/files
        }
    }

    handle {
        reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:5174
    }
}
```

## Caddyfile Locations in Belimbing

Belimbing checks for Caddyfiles in this order:

1. **`/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`** - System-wide (Linux)
   - Detected but never modified
   - Belimbing runs a project-specific Caddy using the repo-root `Caddyfile`

2. **`$HOME/.config/caddy/Caddyfile`** - User-level
   - Can be updated if Belimbing config exists

3. **`$PROJECT_ROOT/Caddyfile`** - Project-specific
   - Can be updated when domains change

4. **`/usr/local/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`** - System-wide (macOS/Homebrew)
   - Detected but never modified
   - Belimbing runs a project-specific Caddy using the repo-root `Caddyfile`

### Belimbing Caddyfile

This is the primary configuration file located at `$PROJECT_ROOT/Caddyfile`.


**Configuration Philosophy: Environment Parity**

Belimbing follows the "Environment Parity" principle: the configuration used in local development should match production as closely as possible.

1.  **Single Source of Truth**: There is only one `Caddyfile`. It is committed to Git and used in all environments.
2.  **Environment Variables**: Differences between environments (domain names, ports, TLS modes) are handled via environment variables (`{$VAR}`).
3.  **Reproducibility**: Because the config is identical, bugs found in production can be easily reproduced locally by simply adjusting the environment variables.

**Performance & Stability:**

-   **Zero-Generation Overhead**: No files are created at runtime.
-   **Immutable Infrastructure**: The config file is static and version-controlled, reducing the risk of "magic" runtime errors.

**Comparison:**

| Approach | Local Dev | Production |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Old (Generated)** | Fast, but different config structure | Different config, hard to debug matches |
| **New (Static)** | Uses `Caddyfile` with `{$APP_DOMAIN}=local` | Uses same `Caddyfile` with `{$APP_DOMAIN}=prod.com` |

**Location:** `$PROJECT_ROOT/Caddyfile`

## Testing Caddyfile Configuration

### Validate Syntax

```bash
caddy validate --config Caddyfile
```

### Test Configuration

```bash
caddy run --config Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile
```

### Dry Run

```bash
caddy adapt --config Caddyfile
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate Issues

If you see certificate errors:

1. **Check certificate files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la certs/
   ```

2. **Regenerate certificates:**
   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   mkcert local.blb.lara local.api.blb.lara
   ```

### Port Conflicts

If ports are in use:

1. **Check what's using the port:**
   ```bash
   sudo lsof -i :443
   ```

2. **Free up port 443:**
   Stop the process using 443 (or disable the conflicting proxy), then retry.

### Reverse Proxy Not Working

1. **Check backend is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

2. **Verify headers are passed:**
   Check Laravel logs for `X-Forwarded-*` headers

3. **Check Caddy logs:**
   ```bash
   tail -f .caddy/logs/local-access.log
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Use `handle` for path-based routing** - More explicit than relying on order
2. **Always pass forwarding headers** - Ensures Laravel knows the original request details
3. **Use project-specific Caddyfiles** - Avoid modifying system files
4. **Keep certificates in `certs/` directory** - Organized and easy to manage
5. **Use environment-specific files** - Separate configs for local, staging, production
